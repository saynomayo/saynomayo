(**I'm the guy on the right 😸.** My best pictures seem to be with my girlfriend.
A professional composition is definitely on the way.)

- If you are reading this then you've probably come here from my resume 📃.
This Github profile contains software that I've written.
Some of that software is **self-written**, and some of it is the product of **collaboration with my classmates**.

- Since my software projects are visible in my repositories, I'll include some less technical information about myself
from this point forward

- 🎤 **I love music**, but not just how most people say they love music. 
Currently, I am not only a member, but the **treasurer** of the only **all-male acapella** organization at my University. 
We do gigs sometimes and a concert at the end of each semester. 🎤
